## Date: 11-30-2025

- Content script receives and displays progress updates
- Loading message updates after 10 seconds to inform users

#### 3. Enhanced UI Feedback

- Initial message: "Analyzing video..."
- After 10 seconds: "Still analyzing... This may take up to 2 minutes"

- Cancel button receives focus for accessibility
