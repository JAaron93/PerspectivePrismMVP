# Panel State Persistence - Quick Summary

## What Was Implemented

Panel state persistence during YouTube video navigation. When a user has the analysis panel open and navigates to a different video, the panel automatically triggers analysis for the new video and remains open.

## Key Changes

1. **Added state tracking**: `wasPanelOpen` flag tracks if panel was open before navigation
2. **Updated panel functions**: All panel display functions now set `wasPanelOpen = true`
3. **Enhanced cleanup**: `cleanup()` preserves panel state during navigation
4. **Auto-analysis**: `handleNavigation()` automatically triggers analysis if panel was open
5. **User control**: Explicitly closing the panel (× button or Escape) prevents auto-reopening

## User Experience

### Before
- User opens panel on Video A
- User navigates to Video B
- Panel closes
- User must manually click "Analyze" again

### After
- User opens panel on Video A
- User navigates to Video B
- Panel automatically shows loading state
- Panel displays analysis for Video B
- Seamless workflow maintained
