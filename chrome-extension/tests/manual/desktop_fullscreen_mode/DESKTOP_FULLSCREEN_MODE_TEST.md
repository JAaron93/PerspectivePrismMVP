# Desktop Fullscreen Mode - Comprehensive Test Document

## Test Overview

**Test Type**: Manual Functional Testing  
**Component**: Perspective Prism Chrome Extension  
**Layout**: YouTube Desktop Fullscreen Mode  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***  
**Tester**: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures for the Perspective Prism Chrome extension in YouTube's desktop fullscreen mode. Fullscreen mode presents unique challenges as YouTube hides most UI elements and the extension must handle transitions gracefully.

### Key Testing Focus Areas

1. **Pre-Fullscreen State**: Button injection and panel functionality
2. **Fullscreen Transition**: Panel persistence during mode change
3. **In-Fullscreen Behavior**: Panel accessibility and interaction
4. **Exit Fullscreen**: Extension state recovery
5. **Edge Cases**: Rapid toggling, navigation, keyboard handling

---

## Test Environment

### Hardware Requirements

- **Processor**: Modern multi-core CPU
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum
- **Display**: 1920x1080 or higher resolution
- **Input**: Keyboard and mouse

### Software Requirements

- **Browser**: Google Chrome (latest stable version)
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.15+, or Linux
- **Extension**: Perspective Prism (loaded in developer mode)
- **Backend**: Perspective Prism backend server running

### Test Data

- **Primary Test Video**: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
- **Alternative Videos**: Any YouTube video with transcript
- **Backend URL**: `http://localhost:8000` (or configured URL)

---

## Fullscreen Mode Characteristics

Fullscreen mode is activated by clicking the fullscreen button (⛶) in YouTube's video player controls or pressing the 'f' key. In fullscreen mode:

- The video player expands to fill the entire screen
- All page UI elements are hidden (sidebar, description, comments)
- Browser UI is hidden (address bar, tabs, bookmarks bar)
- Video controls appear as an overlay on mouse movement
- Controls auto-hide after a few seconds of inactivity
- The DOM structure remains largely the same, but visibility changes

### Implications for Extension

1. **Button Visibility**: The Analyze button is hidden when controls are hidden
2. **Panel Persistence**: The panel must remain visible if opened before fullscreen
3. **Z-Index Management**: Panel must appear above fullscreen video
4. **State Recovery**: Extension must recover gracefully when exiting fullscreen
5. **Keyboard Handling**: Escape key must close panel first, then exit fullscreen
