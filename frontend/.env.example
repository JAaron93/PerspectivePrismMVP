# API Configuration
# ==================
# VITE_API_URL: Base URL for backend API requests from the frontend
# 
# Purpose: Specifies the full URL (including protocol and port) where the 
#          frontend should send API requests to the backend server.
#
# Format:  Must include protocol (http:// or https://) and port number
#          Examples: 
#          - Development: http://localhost:8000
#          - Production: https://api.yourdomain.com
#
# IMPORTANT: This value MUST match the backend server's host and port.
#            The backend currently runs on port 8000 in development.
#            Update this if you change the backend port in:
#            - backend/.env (if configured)
#            - backend uvicorn command (default: --port 8000)
#
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
