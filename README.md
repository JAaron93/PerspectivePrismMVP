## 🧐 Problem Statement

In the age of algorithmic feeds, users are often trapped in filter bubbles where they only encounter information that reinforces their existing beliefs. Misinformation spreads rapidly on video platforms like YouTube, where verifying claims requires significant effort (cross-referencing sources, checking scientific consensus, etc.). Most users simply don't have the time or expertise to fact-check every video they watch.

## ✨ Solution Statement

Perspective Prism is an AI agent that acts as an automated, multi-perspective fact-checker. It analyzes YouTube video transcripts to identify verifiable claims, retrieves supporting or refuting evidence from trusted sources, evaluates bias and credibility, and presents a comprehensive "Truth Profile" to help users make informed decisions about the content they consume.

## 🏗️ Architecture

[See detailed architecture](architecture.md)

![Perspective Prism Architecture](assets/img_1764592936221.png)
Perspective Prism operates as a pipeline of specialized sub-agents:

1.  **Claim Extractor**: Uses an LLM to parse YouTube transcripts and identify distinct, verifiable claims.
2.  **Evidence Retriever**: Dynamically queries the Google Custom Search API to find external evidence.
3.  **Analysis Engine**: Synthesizes the claim and retrieved evidence to determine support/refutation and detects bias.
4.  **Truth Profiler**: Aggregates these insights into a user-friendly "Truth Profile".

## 🦾 Essential Tools and Utilities

The Perspective Prism multi-agent system is equipped with custom-built tools designed to ensure security, quality, and effectiveness throughout the analysis pipeline.

### Input Sanitizer (`input_sanitizer.py`)

A critical security tool that protects against Large Language Model (LLM) prompt injection attacks. Before any user-provided data (YouTube URLs, transcript text, or claims) is interpolated into LLM prompts, the sanitizer performs comprehensive validation. It detects and blocks suspicious patterns like `ignore previous instructions`, `system:`, `<|im_start|>`, and other common injection techniques. The tool employs multiple defense layers: control character detection, pattern matching against a curated blocklist, special character escaping, and strict length enforcement. Additionally, it wraps user data in clearly delimited sections using `===USER DATA START===` and `===USER DATA END===` markers, making it explicit to the LLM where untrusted input begins and ends. This proactive approach prevents malicious actors from manipulating the agent's behavior or extracting sensitive system prompts.

### Agent Evaluator (`evaluate_agents.py`)

A benchmarking framework that validates the entire analysis pipeline against a curated set of test videos containing verifiable factual claims. The evaluator measures three key performance metrics: **Success Rate** (percentage of successful analyses without errors), **Latency** (time breakdown for claim extraction vs. evidence analysis), and **Output Quality** (validation that Truth Profiles contain properly structured perspectives and bias indicators). It runs automated tests on videos spanning diverse topics—TED Talks on data science, Bill Gates' pandemic preparedness presentation, and NASA's Artemis program announcements—ensuring the system can handle scientific, public health, and engineering claims. The benchmark script integrates directly with the `ClaimExtractor`, `EvidenceRetriever`, and `AnalysisService` to measure end-to-end performance, providing detailed timing breakdowns and failure diagnostics to support continuous improvement.

### Evidence Retriever (`evidence_retriever.py`)

A sophisticated multi-perspective search tool that queries the Google Custom Search API to gather external evidence for each extracted claim. Rather than performing a single generic search, the Evidence Retriever executes **perspective-specific queries**—tailoring search terms to find scientific studies (`site:nih.gov OR site:nature.com`), journalistic sources (`site:nytimes.com OR site:reuters.com`), and partisan viewpoints. It handles API quota limits gracefully, implements exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures, and normalizes search results into a consistent format (title, snippet, URL). The retriever also performs relevance filtering, discarding results that don't contain claim-related keywords, ensuring the `AnalysisService` receives only high-quality evidence. This tool is essential for transforming subjective claims into fact-checkable assertions backed by authoritative external sources.

## 🏁 Conclusion

Perspective Prism addresses the core problem of filter bubbles and misinformation by automating the fact-checking process that most users don't have time to perform manually. When a user submits a YouTube video URL, the system retrieves the video's transcript and initiates a sophisticated multi-agent workflow. The **Claim Extractor** agent uses large language models to intelligently parse the transcript, identifying specific claims that can be verified rather than opinions or subjective statements. Each extracted claim is then passed to the **Evidence Retriever** agent, which conducts targeted searches across trusted external sources using the Google Custom Search API. The **Analysis Engine** synthesizes this evidence with the original claim, evaluating the degree of support or refutation while simultaneously detecting logical fallacies, emotional manipulation tactics, and other bias indicators. Finally, the **Truth Profiler** aggregates these multi-perspective analyses into a comprehensive report that presents users with a balanced view—showing not just whether claims are true or false, but _how_ different perspectives (scientific, journalistic, partisan) interpret the same information. This automated pipeline transforms hours of manual research into seconds of computational analysis, empowering users to escape their filter bubbles and make informed decisions about the content they consume.

## 💎 Why This Matters

In an era where video content increasingly shapes public opinion and political discourse, the ability to quickly verify claims and detect bias is not just convenient—it's essential for a healthy democracy. Perspective Prism democratizes access to multi-perspective fact-checking, a capability typically reserved for professional journalists and researchers. By surfacing bias indicators and presenting evidence from multiple viewpoints, the system helps users develop critical thinking skills and resist manipulation. The project demonstrates how AI agents can be harnessed not to replace human judgment, but to augment it with comprehensive, rapid analysis that would be impractical to conduct manually.

## 🗣️ Value Statement

I used Perspective Prism to analyze claims from a political commentary video, discovering that 3 out of 7 major claims lacked credible supporting evidence and exhibited strong emotional manipulation tactics. Armed with this Truth Profile, I was able to disuade an acquaintance from taking the video's claims at face value, which would have otherwise reinforced their existing beliefs.

**Future Enhancements**: With additional development time, I plan to apply comprehensive quality assurance to the Chrome extension, including:

- **Advanced Accessibility Features**
  - Arrow key navigation for claims (Up/Down to navigate, Left/Right to expand/collapse)
  - ClaimNavigator class with screen reader announcements
  - ARIA live regions for dynamic state updates
  - Home/End key support for first/last claim navigation

- **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
  - CI/CD pipeline with automated unit and integration tests on every commit
  - Manual testing across browser variants (Chrome, Brave, Edge) and YouTube layouts (desktop, mobile, Shorts, embedded)
  - Accessibility testing with screen readers (NVDA/JAWS) and keyboard-only navigation
  - Performance benchmarking (memory usage, page load impact, cache efficiency)

- **Structured Logging & Monitoring**
  - Privacy-safe logging utility that sanitizes URLs, tokens, and user data
  - Metrics tracking for selector success rates, cache hit/miss ratios, and API performance
  - Error aggregation for debugging production issues

## 🔄 Workflow

The Perspective Prism analysis pipeline follows this workflow:

1. **Input Validation**: User submits a YouTube video URL through the frontend. The backend validates the URL format and checks for required API credentials.

2. **Transcript Retrieval**: The **Claim Extractor** service extracts the video ID from the URL and fetches the video transcript using the YouTube Transcript API. If no transcript is available, the analysis fails gracefully with an error message.

3. **Claim Extraction**: The **Claim Extractor** uses an LLM (OpenAI GPT) to parse the transcript and identify distinct, verifiable claims. It filters out opinions, questions, and subjective statements, focusing only on factual assertions that can be verified.

4. **Evidence Gathering**: For each extracted claim, the **Evidence Retriever** performs targeted searches across multiple perspectives (scientific, journalistic, partisan left/right) using the Google Custom Search API. It collects relevant articles, studies, and sources for each perspective.

5. **Perspective Analysis**: The **Analysis Service** synthesizes each claim with its gathered evidence. For each perspective, it determines:
   - **Assessment**: Whether the evidence supports, refutes, or is neutral toward the claim
   - **Confidence**: How strongly the evidence supports the assessment (0-100%)
   - **Supporting Evidence**: Specific sources and quotes backing the assessment

6. **Bias Detection**: The **Analysis Service** analyzes each claim for bias indicators, including:
   - Logical fallacies (ad hominem, straw man, false dichotomy, etc.)
   - Emotional manipulation tactics (fear-mongering, appeal to emotion)
   - Deception score (0-100 scale indicating likelihood of intentional misinformation)

7. **Truth Profile Generation**: The system aggregates all perspective analyses and bias indicators into a comprehensive "Truth Profile" for each claim, showing users a balanced view across multiple viewpoints.

8. **Response**: The backend returns the complete analysis (video metadata, claims, and Truth Profiles) to the frontend, which renders an interactive UI displaying the results with expandable claims, color-coded confidence bars, and detailed evidence citations.
